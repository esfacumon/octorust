# Octorust 👾🦀
 
## Description 🧬

`Octorust` is a CHIP-8 interpreter/emulator in the making, written in Rust. This project aims to offer a reliable and efficient implementation of the CHIP-8 system for educational and development purposes.

## Features 💫

- CHIP-8 instruction interpretation

## Development Status 🖌️

This project is in its early stages but aims to provide a solid foundation for CHIP-8 emulation.
  - Basic instructions:
    - ✅ `00E0`: clear screen
    - ✅ `1NNN`: jump
    - ✅ `2NNN`: subroutine call
    - ⌛ `00EE`: subroutine return
    - 🔜 `6XNN`: set register VX
    - 🔜 `7XNN`: add value to register VX
    - 🔜 `ANNN`: set index register I
    - 🔜 `DXYN`: display/draw
  - Rest of instructions:
    🔜
  - Input handling:
    🔜

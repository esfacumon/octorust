# Octorust 👾🦀
 
## Description 🧬

`Octorust` is a CHIP-8 interpreter/emulator in the making, written in Rust. This project aims to offer a reliable and efficient implementation of the CHIP-8 system for educational and development purposes.

## Features 💫

- CHIP-8 instruction interpretation

## Development Status 🖌️

This project is in its early stages but aims to provide a solid foundation for CHIP-8 emulation.

### Basic instructions

This instructions are needed to run the most basic ROM available for Chip8, which displays IBM Logo on screen

  | Status   | Code   | Instruction |
  |:--------:|:------:|-------------| 
  | ✅       | `00E0` | clear screen |
  | ✅       | `1NNN` | jump |
  | ✅       | `6XNN` | set register VX |
  | ✅       | `7XNN` | add value to register VX |
  | ✅       | `ANNN` | set index register I
  | ✅       | `DXYN` | display/draw
  
### Rest of instructions
  | Status    | Code   | Instruction |
